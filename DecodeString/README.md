# Decode String Problem

## Problem Description

Write a program that decodes an encoded string where each character is followed by a digit representing how many times that character should be repeated.

## Example

**Input:**
Enter the encoded string: a3b2c4

**Output:**
aaabbcccccd 

## Description

Suppose you input the string `a3b2c4`.

The program reads the encoded string and decodes it by repeating each character based on the number following it. In this case:
- The character `a` is repeated 3 times.
- The character `b` is repeated 2 times.
- The character `c` is repeated 4 times.

So, the final decoded string is `aaabbcccc`.
