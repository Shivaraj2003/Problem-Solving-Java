### Problem Description

Write a program that finds the number of integers in a given range where all the digits in each number are unique.

### Example

**Input:**
- Lower limit: `11`
- Upper limit: `15`

**Output:**
- Total numbers with distinct digits: `4`

### Description
Suppose n1=11 and n2=15.

There is the number 11, which has repeated digits, but 12, 13, 14 and 15 have no repeated digits. So, the output is 4.
